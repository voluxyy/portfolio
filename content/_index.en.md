# Welcome to my Portfolio ðŸ‘‹

This portfolio presents my internship carried out in 2024 at the company [Bashroom](./bashroom).

I will present the tasks that were given to me during the internship and then link them to what I learned at Ynov and how it helped me during the internship.

{% alert(tip=true) %}
If you don't know me, I invite you to visit the [WhoAmI](./whoami) page.
