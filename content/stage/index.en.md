## Conclusion on this Experience

I decided to discuss these three tasks, which were assigned to me during this internship at Bashroom, because they were the tasks that taught me the most and took up the majority of my internship time. I had other tasks during my internship that were very short and less impactful, such as translating Python code from Google Colab into R in a Kaggle.

This internship was my second experience with Bashroom, where I integrated further into the company by gaining access to the companyâ€™s repositories with my personal Bashroom account to deposit the code I wrote during this internship. This internship was beneficial for putting into practice what I learned at Ynov, as well as applying important skills within a company such as communication, autonomy, and a sense of responsibility.
