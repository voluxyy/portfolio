# Portfolio

This project is my portfolio of my stage to validate my second year at Ynov Campus Toulouse.

It is made using [zola](https://www.getzola.org/). It is a framework to make static website very easily.\
The website is reachable at this url: [voluxyy.github.io/portfolio](https://voluxyy.github.io/portfolio)

## Informations

If you want to serve the website in local, you must use zola v0.19.1 or more.

Download zola v0.19.1 [here](https://github.com/getzola/zola/releases/tag/v0.19.1).

Install it and when it's done, just run this command in the root folder:

```bash
zola serve
```
